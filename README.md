# Voice-Assistant


This Software aims at developing a personal assistant for Linux-based systems. The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the user at certain commands, provided in either of the ways, speech or text. It will ease most of the work of the user as a complete task can be done on a single command. Jarvis draws its inspiration from Virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows and Siri for iOS. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands or keyboard input.


Speech recognition The proposed system used the google API to convert input speech into text. The speech is given as an input to google cloud for processing, As an output, the system then receives the resulting text.
